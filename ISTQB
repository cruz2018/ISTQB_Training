1.1 What is Testing?
Software systems are an integral part of life, from business applications (e.g., banking) to consumer products (e.g., cars). Most people had an experience with software that did not work as expected. Software that does not work correctly can lead to many problems, including loss of money, time, or business reputation, and even injury or death.
Software testing is a way to assess the quality of the software and to reduce the risk of software failure in operation.

A common misperception of testing is that it only consists of running tests, i.e., executing the software and checking the results. The test process also includes activities such as test planning, analyzing, designing, and implementing tests, reporting testing process and results, and evaluating the quality of a test object.

Some testing does involve the execution of the component or system being tested; such testing is called dynamic testing. Other testing does not involve checking whether the system being tested; such testing is called static testing. So, testing also includes reviewing work products such as requirements, user stories, and source code.


1.1.1 Typical Objectives of Testing
For any given project, the objectives of testing may include:
To prevent defects by evaluate work products such as requirements, user stories, design and code.
To verify whether all specified requirements have been fulfilled. 
To check whether the test objects is complete and validate if it works as the users and other stakeholders expected.
To build confidence in the level of quality of the test object
To find defects and failures thus reduce the level of risk of inadequate software quality
To provide sufficient information to stakeholders to allow them to make informed decisions, especially regarding the level of quality of the test object
To comply with contractual, legal or regulary requirement or standards, and/or to verify the test object's complince with such requerements or standards.
The objectives of testing can vary, depending upon the context of the components or system being tested.
During component testing, one onjective may be to find as many failures as possible so that the underlyning defects are identified and fixed early.
Another objective may be to increase code coverage of the component tests.Add

Internet of Things(IoT) systems, which consist of many different objects, such as devices, products, and services, typically aply separate software development
lifecycle models for each object. This present a particular challenge for the development of Internet of Things system versions.
Additionally the software development  lifecycle of such objects places stronger emphasis on the later phases of the software development 
lifecycle after the have beeb introducted to operational use (e.g., operate, update, and decommission phases.)
